## Projects and Practical Experience

- Web Log Analysis for Malicious Requests - Deloitte Australia Job Simulation

  I analyzed web log activities to detect the source IP address of malicious requests targeting a company's internal corporate network. I provided a detailed advisory to the client on how to strengthen their cybersecurity posture, focusing on proactive threat detection and network protection strategies.

- Phishing Awareness and Metrics Analysis - Mastercard Cybersecurity Job Simulation

  In this simulation, I led a phishing email test targeting employees within the organization. I tracked and analyzed key engagement metrics, including the Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Email Open Rate. From the findings, I identified departments that were most vulnerable to phishing attacks and provided recommendations for targeted cybersecurity awareness training to mitigate future risks.

- Incident Response and Malware Containment - TryHackMe Incident Response Process

  As part of the Incident Response team, I investigated a cyber attack on an endpoint system infected with a malicious macro that downloaded a crypto miner malware. The malware slowed down system performance and created a persistence mechanism by modifying the system's run registry keys. I worked to isolate the compromised machine from the network, deleted the macro and related malware files, removed the system's download history to prevent reinfection, and flagged the malicious source IP address in the organization's SIEM. I also added the IP address to the network's firewall blocklist to prevent future compromises.

- File Encryption with GPG and OpenSSL - TryHackMe Introduction to Cryptography

  In the TryHackMe Introduction to Cryptography room, I performed symmetric encryption on sensitive files using GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) and OpenSSL. This exercise demonstrated my understanding of symmetric key cryptography and secure file protection techniques, building a strong foundation for implementing encryption methods to maintain data confidentiality.
